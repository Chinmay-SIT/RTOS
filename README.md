# RTOS
Buidling my own RTOS from scratch on STM32F429 discovery board using stm32cube-IDE

This repository documents my journey of building a custom Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) from scratch for the STM32F429I-DISC1 board using STM32CubeIDE.
Project Overview

This project aims to implement a lightweight RTOS with key features such as:
- Task scheduling
-  Context switching
-  Inter-task communication
-  Synchronization mechanisms (e.g., semaphores, mutexes)
-  Hardware abstraction layer for peripheral control
Current Progress

  ### LED Driver Implementation (Basic GPIO control for LED on PA5)

Upcoming Milestones

    1. Implement a basic scheduler
    2. Add task management features
    3. Develop synchronization primitives

    About the Project

This project is a hands-on learning journey in RTOS development, with regular updates as new features are added.

Stay tuned for more progress! ðŸš€
